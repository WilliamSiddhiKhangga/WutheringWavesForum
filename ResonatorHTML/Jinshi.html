        <h2>Jinshi Overview</h2>
        <p>In Wuthering Waves, Jinhsi is a 5-Stars Spectro character and uses Broadblade during the fight.</p>

        <p>
            After Jinhsi uses her Skill, she enters the 'Incarnation' state. Using the 4th enhanced Basic Attack during this state grants her 'Ordination Glow'. 
            Once 'Ordination Glow' is obtained, both her Skill and Basic Attack are further enhanced. The enhanced Skill becomes Jinhsi's primary source of damage. 
            Teammates' attacks can generate 'Incandescence', which increases the damage of the enhanced Skill. Coordinated attacks can generate even more 'Incandescence', so Jinhsi's teammates should primarily be characters with coordinated attack mechanisms.”
        </p>
            
        <p>
            When Xiangli Yao uses Resonance Liberation, it deals massive damage and grants him 3 “Hypercubes.” 
            The Forte Circuit then transforms into “Performance Capacity”, with a limit of 5 points. His RS is enhanced into another form, 
            where each use of the enhanced RS in the Liberation state consumes one “Hypercube.” After consuming all 3 Hypercubes, he exits 
            the Liberation state. When using the enhanced RS, he can also follow up with an enhanced Mid-Air Attack. “Performance Capacity” 
            can be generated by using enhanced RS in the Liberation state (2 points), enhanced Mid-Air Attack (3 points), and the 3-stage 
            enhanced Basic Attack in the Liberation state (a total of 5 points). When “Performance Capacity” reaches 5 points, the ultimate 
            enhanced RS can be used.
        </p>
            
        <br>

        <span class="highlight">Pros</span>
        <li>Unlike most characters, Jinhsi initiates her burst phase with a Skill, offering greater flexibility.</li>
        <li>Excellent damage, effective against both single targets and groups.</li>

        <br>

        <span class="highlight">Cons</span>
        <li>
            Virtually none.

                While in Incarnation: - Alternative Basic Attack "Incarnation - Basic Attack" becomes available. Perform up to 4 consecutive strikes, dealing Spectro DMG considered as Resonance Skill DMG. The basic attack cycle of this will not be reset.

            <span class="highlight">Resonance Skill - Illuminous Epiphany</span>
            <br>
                After Stage 4 of Incarnation - Basic Attack, Incarnation terminates and Jinhsi gains Ordination Glow. Can be cast in mid-air. While Ordination Glow lasts: - Basic Attack is replaced with Heavy Attack "Incarnation - Heavy Attack". 
                Attack the target in mid-air at the cost of Stamina, dealing Spectro DMG. - Resonance Skill is replaced with Resonance Skill "Illuminous Epiphany". Send out Solar Flare that detonates as Stella Glamor, dealing Spectro DMG after a short delay. 
                Consume up to 50 Incandescence, with each point of Incandescence granting bonus DMG Multiplier percentage to Stella Glamor. Can be cast in mid-air. - After casting Resonance Skill Illuminous Epiphany, Jinhsi gains Unison. This can be triggered once every 25s.

            <span class="highlight">Unison</span>
            <br>
                While Jinhsi has Unison, switching to other Resonators will remove Jinhsi's Unison to trigger Jinhsi's Outro Skill and the incoming Resonator's Intro Skill. Unison will be consumed in priority in place of Concerto Energy when Concerto Energy is full.
            
            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">Incandescence</span>
            <br>
                Jinhsi can hold up to 50 Incandescence. When Jinhsi is in the party, all nearby Resonators in the party gain Eras in Unity. Eras in Unity provides 2 independent effects: Jinhsi gains 1 Incandescence anytime Resonators in the party inflict Attribute DMG. 
                This effect may be triggered by damage of the same Attribute for up to 1 time(s) every 3s. Additionally, Jinhsi gains 2 Incandescence when Resonators in the party damage the enemy with Coordinated Attacks. This effect may be triggered by Coordinated Attacks of the same Attribute for up to 1 time(s) every 3s.

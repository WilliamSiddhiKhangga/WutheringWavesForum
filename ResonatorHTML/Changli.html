        <h2>Changli Overview</h2>
        <p>In Wuthering Waves, Changli is a 5 Stars Fusion character and uses a Sword during the fight.</p>

        <p>
            When Changli uses the <span class="highlight">Resonance Skill</span>, <span class="highlight">Intro Skill</span>, 
            <span class="highlight">Ground Basic Attack 4</span>, or <span class="highlight">Mid-air Basic Attack 4</span>, 
            Changli enters a state called <span class="highlight">True Sight</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            During <span class="highlight">True Sight</span>, Changli's Basic Attack will be enhanced. This enhanced attack can be used 
            on the ground or in mid-air, and is called <span class="highlight">True Sight - Conquest</span> and 
            <span class="highlight">True Sight - Charge</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After using <span class="highlight">Conquest</span> or <span class="highlight">Charge</span>, Changli will gain 1 stack of 
            <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span>. The maximum stack of <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span> is 4.
        </p>

        <p>
            When <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span> reaches 4 stacks, Changli can use the Heavy Attack: 
            <span class="highlight">Flaming Sacrifice</span>, which is Changli's main source of damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to using <span class="highlight">Conquest</span> or <span class="highlight">Charge</span>, 
            Changli's <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> can also gain <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span>, 
            and it can reach up to 4 stacks immediately.
        </p>

        <p class="summary">
            Summary: By using the <span class="highlight">Resonance Skill</span>, <span class="highlight">Intro Skill</span>, 
            <span class="highlight">Ground Basic Attack 4</span>, or <span class="highlight">Mid-air Basic Attack 4</span>, 
            Changli enters <span class="highlight">True Sight</span> and can use <span class="highlight">Conquest</span> or 
            <span class="highlight">Charge</span> once, gaining 1 stack of <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span>.
            After using <span class="highlight">Conquest</span> or <span class="highlight">Charge</span> 4 times, 
            or by directly using <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> to reach 4 stacks of <span class="highlight">Enflamement</span>, 
            the <span class="highlight">Heavy Attack: Flaming Sacrifice</span> can be used.

                After releasing Resonance Skill, Changli dashes towards the enemy and enters True Sight, lasting for 12s. 
                In the end, she releases a plunging attack, dealing Fusion DMG. True Sight: Capture has 2 initial charges and holds up to 2 charges in maximum.

            <br>
                When releasing Heavy Attack, if Changli carries 4 stacks of Enflamement, she consumes all stacks of Enflamement to cast Flaming Sacrifice, dealing Fusion DMG, considered as Resonance Skill DMG. While casting Flaming Sacrifice, Changli takes 40% less DMG.

            <br>
                Primarily provides Changli with anti-interruption. Note that both 'Basic Attack: True Sight - Conquest' and 'Basic Attack: True Sight - Charge' benefit from this effect.

            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">S2</span>
            <br>
                With Changli's frequent use of 'Basic Attack: True Sight - Conquest' and 'Basic Attack: True Sight - Charge,' this buff is effectively always active. This increases Changli's damage by approximately 19.26%.

            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">S3</span>
            <br>
                Liberation's damage is increased by 80%. Although the percentage increase is significant, considering Changli's Liberation does not contribute heavily to overall damage, the actual improvement is about 7.96%.

            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">S4</span>
            <br>
                After using Intro Skill, the whole team's attack is increased by 20%. This enhances Changli's support capability, providing approximately a 10.4% boost to Changli's damage. 
                As Changli is a Sub DPS/Support in the team, the actual benefit from S4 might be significantly higher. For example, in a team with Jinhsi and Changli, this 20% attack increase boosts Jinhsi's damage by about 7.5%.

            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">S5</span>
            <br>
                The Heavy Attack Flaming Sacrifice's multiplier is increased by 50%, and the damage dealt is increased by 50%, resulting in a total improvement of about 25.72%.

            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">S6</span>
            <br>
                Changli additionally ignores 40% of the enemy's defense, resulting in an overall damage increase of approximately 38.11%.

        <h2>Xiangli Yao Overview</h2>
        <p>In Wuthering Waves, Xiangli Yao is a 5-Stars Electro character and uses Gauntlet during the fight.</p>

        <p>
            In a normal state, Xiangli Yao's Forte Circuit energy is called “Capacity,” with a maximum limit of 100 points, 
            primarily obtained through Resonance Skill and Basic Attack. When “Capacity” reaches 100, Xiangli Yao's RS (Resonance Skill) 
            will be enhanced, doubling its damage. When used, he leaps into the air, and if he uses Basic Attack mid-air, it triggers an 
            enhanced Mid-Air Attack.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            When Xiangli Yao uses Resonance Liberation, it deals massive damage and grants him 3 “Hypercubes.” 
            The Forte Circuit then transforms into “Performance Capacity”, with a limit of 5 points. His RS is enhanced into another form, 
            where each use of the enhanced RS in the Liberation state consumes one “Hypercube.” After consuming all 3 Hypercubes, he exits 
            the Liberation state. When using the enhanced RS, he can also follow up with an enhanced Mid-Air Attack. “Performance Capacity” 
            can be generated by using enhanced RS in the Liberation state (2 points), enhanced Mid-Air Attack (3 points), and the 3-stage 
            enhanced Basic Attack in the Liberation state (a total of 5 points). When “Performance Capacity” reaches 5 points, the ultimate 
            enhanced RS can be used.
        </p>
            
        <br>

        <span class="highlight">Pros</span>
        <li>When using Liberation and the ultimate enhanced Resonance Skill, 
            a zone is created that slows down enemy actions, increasing Xiangli 
            Yao's survival rate.
        </li>
        <li>It's free.</li>

        <br>

        <span class="highlight">Cons</span>
        <li>
            Damage output is not outstanding when comparing with other limited 5-star Main DPS.
        </li>
